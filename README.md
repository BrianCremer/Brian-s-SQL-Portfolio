Hello, my name is Brian Cremer. I graduated from SUNY Cortland in 2018 with a B.S. in Geographic Information Systems with a minor in Computer Applications. This degree brought me opportunities to be a Land Surveyor, collecting data for construction and pre-construction projects. Although this was a great job, I realized my passion was analyzing data and providing visualizations to interpret the data more clearly. In my undergraduate degree I spent a majority of the time doing this. I began to learn SQL, Tableau, and becoming more proficient in Excel in the hopes to land a career as a data analyst. I hope you enjoy looking through my SQL portfolio and thank you for taking the time to read my story.
